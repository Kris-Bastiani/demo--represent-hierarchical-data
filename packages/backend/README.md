# Momenton technical test: back-end

## Dependencies

I have used ExpressJS and Mongoose to work with a MongoDB database,
for the sake of getting this up and running quickly and with a minimum of fuss.

## How to run

- Ensure that NodeJS is installed. This project uses major version 12; the specific version at the time of writing is v12.16.3
- Ensure that MongoDB is installed. The specific version at the time of writing is 4.2.6
- In a Terminal instance, run `mongod` to start MongoDB
- In a separate Terminal instance, navigate to this project's directory and run `npm install` to install the relevant dependencies
- Once done, run `npm run start` to start the server on port 3002
